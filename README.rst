emusavelib
==========

emusavelib is a python library and utilities for working with emulator save
formats.

Features
--------
Right now emusavelib only supports PS1 memory cards. I might add other
formats using the same technique, and pull requests accepted.

`ps1mcfs.py` can be used to mount a PS1 memory card as a read-only filesystem
on linux using llfuse.
